## 3. Prioritizing Feature Requests (Product & Engineering)

### **Prioritization Factors**

- Hold **regular QBRs/EBRs** to uncover new needs and expansion opportunities.
- Monitor **usage patterns, health scores, and adoption metrics** closely.

# Task 2: Expanding an Existing Customer (Example: HubSpot)

## 1. What Stands Out About How HubSpot Uses Mintlify

- HubSpot has a large developer ecosystem, making world-class documentation essential.
- They use Mintlify to organize and surface developer docs in a clean, fast, navigable experience.
- Autogenerated API references are likely extremely valuable due to the scale of their API suite.
- Mintlify supports accurate, easily updated public-facing documentation at scale.

---

## 2. Expansion Opportunity

### **AI Chat / AI Assistant Expansion**
Opportunities include enabling Mintlify’s AI Assistant across HubSpot’s **internal** documentation:

- Faster onboarding for new engineers  
- Instant answers for internal API or system questions  
- Reduced time spent searching through technical docs  
- Potential extension to *external* developers to reduce support tickets and boost API adoption

---

## 3. Why Haven’t They Adopted It Yet?

- Migrating or consolidating internal documentation is a large technical initiative.
- They may be using internal tools like Confluence, Notion, or custom platforms.
- Budget cycles or resource planning delays.
- Lack of internal alignment or the feature may not yet be top-of-mind.
- They may simply need more information or a deeper value conversation.

---

## 4. What We Need to Learn to Qualify the Opportunity

- Which team currently owns internal documentation.
- What tools they use today—and *why*.
- Pain points with existing systems.
- Update frequency and maintenance challenges.
- Whether internal APIs or systems lack documentation.
- Whether they have adoption issues with internal onboarding.

---

## 5. Signals of Expansion Readiness

- HubSpot reaches out about AI, SSO, or documentation processes.
- Overall usage growth on the Mintlify platform.
- Seat limits approaching capacity.
- Increasing number of APIs being published.
- New documentation initiatives or internal knowledge management projects.
